## 🌐 How It Works

All images use Unsplash's direct image URLs with optimized parameters:

```

```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ No download/upload needed
- ✅ Always available (CDN-hosted)

## 🔄 Hard Refresh (Clear Cache)

If you don't see the new images immediately, do a hard refresh:

- **Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + R`

This clears your browser cache and loads the updated JSON files with new image URLs.

## 🎨 Customizing Images Later

### Option 1: Use Different Unsplash Images
Browse [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com) and copy image URLs:

1. Find an image you like
2. Right-click → Copy Image Address
3. Replace the URL in the JSON file
4. Add `?w=800&h=600&fit=crop` to resize

### Option 2: Use Your Own Images
1. Place your images in the appropriate folder:
   - `/assets/events/` for event images
   - `/assets/blog/` for blog post images
   - `/assets/press/` for press images

2. Update the JSON files with local paths:
   ```json
   "image": "/assets/events/my-event-photo.jpg"
   ```

### Option 3: Other Placeholder Services
- **Picsum Photos:** `https://picsum.photos/800/600`
- **Lorem Picsum:** `https://loremflickr.com/800/600/business`
